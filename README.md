# DrosophilaLabOrganiser
Organiser for people working with fruit flies dedicated to scientists at Department of Cell Biology and Imaging at Institute of Zoology of Jagiellonian University

When I will finish this project it will be an Android app wrote with use of Kotlin. 
The aims of this project are to develop Android app that will make scientist's life, who are working with fruit flies, easier.

Goals: 

1. Calendar with data base that contains sets of fruit flies and dates of their hatching(regular basis). Adding dyeing of biological preparation. Also option of setting series of occurence.
2. Annoucement/event showing on Mobile with an sound/vibration alarm.
3. Calculator for weight to concentration of antibodies.
4. Also normal calculator, so all necessary things will be in one application.
